# Zeeman Slower Simulations

Pleae refer to pdf for a clean idea about the implementation.

Very low temeprature in lab requires laser cooling of atoms. Laser cooling is a technique widely used to obtain BEC(Bose-Einstein condensates). But the major challenge in laser cooling is to acheive a threshold velocity after which cooling could take place. If the velocity of atoms is greater than the threshold velocity, the atom would be cooled but would not be trapped in the region where intense cooling is taking place. To acheive this threshold velocity, the atom is cooled by using Zeeman spliting of energy-level in magnetic field that induce a retardation on the atom. Simulations written in python show the theoritical conditions needed for designing the Zeeman lower along with th heating of coil and other important paramenters. 

Since the experiment is under development, once the design is implemented a detailed and well documented report as well as simulation will be uploaded along with the deviation from the actual values and error analysis. 

The above mentioned code can be used for any acedemic purpose without the need to qoute the author. And no gaurantee is taken for any loss occuring due to any error, since designing of equipment is very expensive.
